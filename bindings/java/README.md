# Java binding

## Build shared library

### Prerequisites

* Build blst by running `make blst` in the [library source directory](../../src).
* Set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to a JDK with an `include` folder containing a `jni.h` file.

make build
```

This will install the shared library in `src/main/resources/ethereum/ckzg4844/lib` with a folder
structure
and name according to the preset selected (mainnet or minimal) and your OS.

All variables which could be passed to the `make` command and the defaults can be found in
the [Makefile](./Makefile).

## Test

```bash
make test
```
