 * Calculates `[coeffs_0]p_0 + [coeffs_1]p_1 + ... + [coeffs_n]p_n` where `n` is `len - 1`.
 *
 * @param[out] out    The resulting sum-product
 * @param[in]  p      Array of G1 group elements, length `len`
 * @param[in]  coeffs Array of field elements, length `len`
 * @param[in]  len    The number of group/field elements
 *
 * @remark This function CAN be called with the point at infinity in `p`.
 * @remark While this function is significantly faster than g1_lincomb_naive(), we refrain from
 * using it in security-critical places (like verification) because the blst Pippenger code has not
 * been audited. In those critical places, we prefer using g1_lincomb_naive() which is much simpler.
 *
 * For the benefit of future generations (since blst has no documentation to speak of), there are
 * two ways to pass the arrays of scalars and points into blst_p1s_mult_pippenger().
 *
 * 1. Pass `points` as an array of pointers to the points, and pass `scalars` as an array of
 *    pointers to the scalars, each of length `len`.
 * 2. Pass an array where the first element is a pointer to the contiguous array of points and the
 *    second is null, and similarly for scalars.
 *
 * We do the second of these to save memory here.
